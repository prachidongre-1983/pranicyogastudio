The purpose of this yoga studio is to make yoga accessible to the East Bay community at affordable rates. We offer in-person, online, and hybrid classes for adults (men and women), seniors, and prenatal clients, with kids’ yoga classes coming soon.
With a PhD in Molecular Biology and Immunology and extensive experience in scientific research, I bring a unique approach to teaching—blending the timeless principles of Patanjali with modern scientific insights. My goal is to provide a clear, logical understanding of yoga while guiding clients toward holistic wellbeing, both physically and mentally. I also offer basic nutritional guidance and advice as needed.
